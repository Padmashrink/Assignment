The folder contains 2 jar files - DirectedAcyclicGraph.jar and Threading.jar, Two project folders - DirectedAcyclicGraph and Threading and a readme file.

I. DirectedAcyclicGraph - This folder contains the source file and the test files for Excercise C. It contains the method AddEdge(String source, String Destination)

Problem description - Add an edge from source to destination and return true if the edge is added as a result of this function. If either source or destination does not exist, create them before adding the edge.

The DirectedAcyclicGraph.jar file contains the jar file for the DirectedAcyclicGraph project.

Method to execute -

1. Run the jar file using the command - 

java -jar DirectedAcyclicGraph.jar

2. To run the source code - 
Run the class file DirectedAcyclicGraph.java file.
javac DirectedAcyclicGraph.java
java DirectedAcyclicGraph


II. Threading - This folder contains the source file and the test files for Excercise A.

Problem Description - Creating a Java program that has three threads, respectively A, B and C. Each thread starts at exactly the same time and concurrently increments the value of some global counter (initially set to 0) by exactly 1. Each time a thread increments the value of the counter from old_value to new_value (e.g old_value + 1), it prints new_value onto the console and stores new_value in a collection.

Each thread should continue to run until the value of the global counter reaches 100 at which point, each thread should print its collection of stored values onto the console. Once complete, the output of your program should be 100 numbers (1-100) in chronological order followed by three collections, each with a distinct subset of the numbers printed.

The Threading.jar file contains the jar file for the Threading project.

Method to execute -

1. Run the jar file using the command - 

java -jar Threading.jar

2. To run the source code - 
Run the class file DirectedAcyclicGraph.java file.
javac Threading.java
java Threading
